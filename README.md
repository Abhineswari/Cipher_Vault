CipherVaultX is an interactive web-based cryptography learning tool built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It allows users to experiment with classical ciphers like Caesar and Vigenere, as well as a simplified version of AES encryption for text and files.

The platform includes visualizations, frequency analysis and brute force attack simulations to demonstrate why older ciphers are weak and why modern encryption is necessary.

This project is designed for educational purposes to help students and beginners understand encryption, decryption  and cryptanalysis in a hands-on visual way.
